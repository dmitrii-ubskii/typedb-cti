# 4.14 Observed Data

**Type Name:** `observed-data`

Observed Data conveys information about cyber security related entities such as files, systems, and networks using the STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs). For example, Observed Data can capture information about an IP address, a network connection, a file, or a registry key. Observed Data is not an intelligence assertion, it is simply the raw information without any context for what it means.

## 4.14.1 Properties

### Required Common Properties
- `type`
- `spec_version`
- `id`
- `created`
- `modified`

### Optional Common Properties
- `created_by_ref`
- `revoked`
- `labels`
- `confidence`
- `lang`
- `external_references`
- `object_marking_refs`
- `granular_markings`
- `extensions`

### Not Applicable Common Properties
- `defanged`

### Observed Data Specific Properties
- `first_observed` (required): The beginning of the time window during which the data was observed.
- `last_observed` (required): The end of the time window during which the data was observed.
- `number_observed` (required): The number of times the data was observed.
- `objects` (optional): A dictionary of SCO objects that describes the observed data. This property MUST NOT be present if object_refs is provided.
- `object_refs` (optional): A list of SCOs and SROs representing the observation. The object_refs MUST contain at least one SCO reference if defined.

The object_refs MAY include multiple SCOs and their corresponding SROs, if those SCOs are related as part of a single observation. For example, a Network Traffic object and two IPv4 Address objects related via the src_ref and dst_ref properties can be contained in the same Observed Data because they are all related and used to characterize that single entity.

This property MUST NOT be present if objects is provided.

## 4.14.2 Relationships

There are no forward relationships explicitly defined between the Observed Data object and other STIX Objects, other than those defined as common relationships. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target. The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships targeting this object type from another object type.

In addition to the relationships created using the generic Relationship object, Observed Data is also a direct target of the Sighting SRO. Sightings represent a relationship between some intelligence entity that was seen (e.g., an Indicator or Malware instance), where it was seen, and what evidence was actually seen. The evidence (or raw data) in that relationship is captured as Observed Data.

### Embedded Relationships
| Property Name | Target |
|--------------|--------|
| created_by_ref | identifier (of type identity) |
| object_marking_refs | list of type identifier (of type marking-definition) |
| object_refs | list of type identifier (of type SCO or SRO) |

### Common Relationships
- `duplicate-of`
- `derived-from`
- `related-to`

### Reverse Relationships
| Source | Relationship Type | Target | Description |
|--------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| indicator | based-on | observed-data | See forward relationship for definition |
| infrastructure | consists-of | observed-data | See forward relationship for definition |
