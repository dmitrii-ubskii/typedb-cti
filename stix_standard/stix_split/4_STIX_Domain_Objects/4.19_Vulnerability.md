# 4.19 Vulnerability

**Type Name:** `vulnerability`

A Vulnerability is a weakness or defect in the requirements, designs, or implementations of the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and some hardware components (e.g., firmware) that can be directly exploited to negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of that system.

CVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that provides common names for publicly known problems [CVE]. For example, if a piece of malware exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a Vulnerability object that references CVE-2015-12345.

The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not yet have an external definition. Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to Vulnerability objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted and exploited as part of malicious cyber activity. As such, Vulnerability objects can be used as a linkage to the asset management and compliance process.

## 4.19.1 Properties

### Not Applicable Common Properties
- `defanged`

### Vulnerability Specific Properties
- `name` (required): A name used to identify the Vulnerability.
- `description` (optional): A description that provides more details and context about the Vulnerability, potentially including its root cause, vulnerabilities, and ways it can be exploited.

## 4.19.2 Relationships

These are the relationships explicitly defined between the Vulnerability object and other STIX Objects. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target.

### Embedded Relationships
| Property Name | Target |
|--------------|--------|
| created_by_ref | identity |
| object_marking_refs | list of type identifier (of type marking-definition) |

### Common Relationships
- `duplicate-of`
- `derived-from`
- `related-to`

### Source/Target Relationships
| Source | Relationship Type | Target | Description |
|--------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| vulnerability | has | infrastructure | This Relationship describes that this Vulnerability exists in this Infrastructure. |
| vulnerability | has | tool | This Relationship describes that this Vulnerability exists in this Tool. |

### Reverse Relationships
| Source | Relationship Type | Target | Description |
|--------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| malware | exploits | vulnerability | See forward relationship for definition |
| course-of-action | mitigates, remediates | vulnerability | See forward relationship for definition |
| infrastructure | has | vulnerability | See forward relationship for definition |
