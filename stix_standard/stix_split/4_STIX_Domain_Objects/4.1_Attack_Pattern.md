# 4.1 Attack Pattern

**Type Name:** `attack-pattern`

Attack Patterns are a type of TTP that describe ways that adversaries attempt to compromise targets. Attack Patterns are used to help categorize attacks, generalize specific attacks to the patterns that they follow, and provide detailed information about how attacks are performed. An example of an attack pattern is "spear phishing": a common type of attack where an attacker sends a carefully crafted e-mail message to a party with the intent of getting them to click a link or open an attachment to deliver malware. Attack Patterns can also be more specific; spear phishing as practiced by a particular threat actor (e.g., they might generally say that the target won a contest) can also be an Attack Pattern.

The Attack Pattern SDO contains textual descriptions of the pattern along with references to externally-defined taxonomies of attacks such as CAPEC [CAPEC].

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| `type` (required) | `string` | The value of this property **MUST** be `attack-pattern`. |
| `external_references` (optional) | `list` of type `external-reference` | A list of external references which refer to non-STIX information. This property **MAY** be used to provide one or more Attack Pattern identifiers, such as a CAPEC ID. When specifying a CAPEC ID, the `source_name` property of the external reference **MUST** be set to `capec` and the `external_id` property **MUST** be formatted as `CAPEC-[id]`. |
| `name` (required) | `string` | A name used to identify the Attack Pattern. |
| `description` (optional) | `string` | A description that provides more details and context about the Attack Pattern, potentially including its purpose and its key characteristics. |
| `aliases` (optional) | `list` of type `string` | Alternative names used to identify this Attack Pattern. |
| `kill_chain_phases` (optional) | `list` of type `kill-chain-phase` | The list of Kill Chain Phases for which this Attack Pattern is used. |

## 4.1.2 Relationships

These are the relationships explicitly defined between the Attack Pattern object and other STIX Objects. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target. The rest of the table identifies the relationships that can be made from this object type to another object type by way of the Relationship object. The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships targeting this object type from another object type. They are included here for convenience. For their definitions, please see the "Source" object.

Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects using the `related-to` relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.
