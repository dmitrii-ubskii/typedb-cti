# 4.4 Grouping
/
**Type Name:** `grouping`
/
A Grouping object explicitly asserts that the referenced STIX Objects have a shared context, unlike a STIX Bundle (which explicitly conveys no context). A Grouping object should not be confused with an intelligence product, which should be conveyed via a STIX Report.
/
A STIX Grouping object might represent a set of data that, in time, given sufficient analysis, would mature to convey an incident or threat report as a STIX Report object. For example, a Grouping could be used to characterize an ongoing investigation into a security event or incident. A Grouping object could also be used to assert that the referenced STIX Objects are related to an ongoing analysis process, such as when a threat analyst is collaborating with others in their trust community to examine a series of Campaigns and Indicators. The Grouping SDO contains a list of references to SDOs, SCOs, SROs, and SMOs, along with an explicit statement of the context shared by the content, a textual description, and the name of the grouping.

/
## 4.4.2 Relationships
/
There are no relationships explicitly defined between the Grouping object and other STIX Objects, other than those defined as common relationships. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target.
/
Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects using the `related-to` relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.
/
### Embedded Relationships
| Property Name | Target |
|--------------|--------|
| created_by_ref | identity |
| object_marking_refs | list of type identifier (of type marking-definition) |
| object_refs | list of type identifier (of type STIX Object) |
/
### Common Relationships
- `duplicate-of`
- `derived-from`
- `related-to`
/
