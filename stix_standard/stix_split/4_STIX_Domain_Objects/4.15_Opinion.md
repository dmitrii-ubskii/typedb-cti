# Opinion

## Type Name: opinion

An Opinion is an assessment of the correctness of the information in a STIX Object produced by a different entity. The primary property is the `opinion` property, which captures the level of agreement or disagreement using a fixed scale. That fixed scale also supports a numeric mapping to allow for consistent statistical operations across opinions.

For example, an analyst from a consuming organization might say that they "strongly disagree" with a Campaign object and provide an explanation about why. In a more automated workflow, a SOC operator might give an Indicator "one star" in their TIP (expressing "strongly disagree") because it is considered to be a false positive within their environment. Opinions are subjective, and the specification does not address how best to interpret them. Sharing communities are encouraged to provide clear guidelines to their constituents regarding best practice for the use of Opinion objects within the community.

Because Opinions are typically (though not always) created by human analysts and are comprised of human-oriented text, they contain an additional property to capture the analyst(s) that created the Opinion. This is distinct from the `created_by_ref` property, which is meant to capture the organization that created the object.

## Properties

### Required Common Properties
- `type` (string) - The value of this property MUST be "opinion"
- `spec_version` (string)
- `id` (string)
- `created` (timestamp)
- `modified` (timestamp)

### Optional Common Properties
- `created_by_ref` (identifier)
- `revoked` (boolean)
- `labels` (list of strings)
- `confidence` (integer)
- `lang` (string)
- `external_references` (list of external references)
- `object_marking_refs` (list of identifiers)
- `granular_markings` (list of granular markings)
- `extensions` (dictionary)

### Not Applicable Common Properties
- `defanged`

### Opinion Specific Properties
- `explanation` (string, optional) - An explanation of why the producer has this Opinion. For example, if an Opinion of strongly-disagree is given, the explanation can contain an explanation of why the Opinion producer disagrees and what evidence they have for their disagreement.
- `authors` (list of strings, optional) - The name of the author(s) of this Opinion (e.g., the analyst(s) that created it).
- `opinion` (enum, required) - The opinion that the producer has about all of the STIX Object(s) listed in the `object_refs` property. The values of this property MUST come from the `opinion-enum` enumeration.
- `object_refs` (list of identifiers, required) - The STIX Objects that this Opinion is about.

## Relationships

There are no forward relationships explicitly defined between the Opinion object and other STIX Objects, other than those defined as common relationships.

### Embedded Relationships
- `created_by_ref` (identifier of type identity)
- `object_marking_refs` (list of identifiers of type marking-definition)
- `object_refs` (list of identifiers of type STIX Object)

### Common Relationships
- `duplicate-of`
- `derived-from`
- `related-to`

### Reverse Relationships
None explicitly defined.
