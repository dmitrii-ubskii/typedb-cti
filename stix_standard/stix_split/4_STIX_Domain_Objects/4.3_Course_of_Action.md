# 4.3 Course of Action
/
**Type Name:** `course-of-action`
/
**Note: The Course of Action object in STIX 2.1 is a stub. It is included to support basic use cases (such as sharing prose courses of action) but does not support the ability to represent automated courses of action or contain properties to represent metadata about courses of action. Future STIX 2 releases will expand it to include these capabilities.**
/
A Course of Action is an action taken either to prevent an attack or to respond to an attack that is in progress. It may describe technical, automatable responses (applying patches, reconfiguring firewalls) but can also describe higher level actions like employee training or policy changes. For example, a course of action to mitigate a vulnerability could describe applying the patch that fixes it.
/
The Course of Action SDO contains a textual description of the action; a reserved `action` property also serves as a placeholder for future inclusion of machine automatable courses of action.
