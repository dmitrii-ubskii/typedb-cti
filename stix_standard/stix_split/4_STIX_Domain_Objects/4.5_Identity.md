# 4.5 Identity
/
**Type Name:** `identity`
/
Identities can represent actual individuals, organizations, or groups (e.g., ACME, Inc.) as well as classes of individuals, organizations, systems or groups (e.g., the finance sector).
/
The Identity SDO can capture basic identifying information, contact information, and the sectors that the Identity belongs to. Identity is used in STIX to represent, among other things, targets of attacks, information sources, object creators, and threat actor identities.

## 4.5.2 Relationships
/
These are the relationships explicitly defined between the Identity object and other STIX Objects. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target. The rest of the table identifies the relationships that can be made from this object type to another object type by way of the Relationship object. The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships targeting this object type from another object type. They are included here for convenience. For their definitions, please see the "Source" object.
/
Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects using the `related-to` relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.
/
### Embedded Relationships
| Property Name | Target |
|--------------|--------|
| created_by_ref | identity |
| object_marking_refs | list of type identifier (of type marking-definition) |
/
### Common Relationships
- `duplicate-of`
- `derived-from`
- `related-to`
/
### Source/Target Relationships
